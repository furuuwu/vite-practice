    <h2>HOW TO FLIRT (AND GET A GIRL WHO LOVES YOU)!?...</h2>

    <p>I'll tell you how right now so read carefully...</p>

    <p>Why are relationships so hard today? Why do we fail at love every time, despite trying so hard? Why have humans
        suddenly become so inept at making relationships last? Have we forgotten how to love? Or worse, forgotten what
        love is?</p>
    <p>We're not prepared. We're not prepared for the sacrifices, for the compromises, for the unconditional love. We're
        not ready to invest all that it takes to make a relationship work. We want everything easy. We're quitters. All
        it takes is a single hurdle to make us crumble to our feet. We don't let our love grow, we let go before time.
        It's not love we're looking for, only excitement and thrill in life. We want someone to watch movies and party
        with, not someone who understands us even in our deepest silences. We spend time together, we don't make
        memories. We don't want the boring life. We don't want a partner for life, just someone who can make us feel
        alive right now, this very instant. When the excitement fades, we discover nobody ever prepared us for the
        mundane. We don't believe in the beauty of predictability because we're too blinded by the thrill of adventure.
    </p>

    <p>
        We immerse ourselves in the inconsequentials of the city life, leaving no space for love. We don't have time to
        love, we don't have the patience to deal with relationships. We're busy people chasing materialistic dreams and
        there's no scope to love. Relationships are nothing more than convenience.
    </p>

    <p>
        We look for instant gratification in everything we do – the things we post online, the careers we choose, and
        the people we fall in love with. We want the maturity in a relationship that comes with time, the emotional
        connect that develops over years, that sense of belonging when we barely even know the other person. Apparently,
        nothing's worth our time and patience – not even love.
    </p>

    <p>
        We'd rather spend an hour each with a hundred people than spending a day with one. We believe in having
        ‘options'. We're ‘social' people. We believe more in meeting people than getting to know them. We're greedy. We
        want to have everything. We get into relationships at the slightest attraction and step out, the moment we find
        someone better. We don't want to bring out the best in that one person. We want them to be perfect. We date a
        lot of people but rarely give any of them a real chance. We're disappointed in everyone.
    </p>

    <p>
        Technology has brought us closer, so close that it's impossible to breathe. Our physical presence has been
        replaced by texts, voice messages, snapchats and video calls. We don't feel the need to spend time together
        anymore. We have too much of each other already. There's nothing left to talk about.
    </p>

    <p>
        We're a generation of ‘wanderers' who wouldn't stay at one place for too long. Everyone is commitment phobic. We
        believe we're not meant for relationships. We don't want to settle down. Even the thought of it is scary. We
        cannot imagine being with one person for the rest of our lives. We walk away. We despise permanence like its
        some social evil. We like to believe we're ‘different' than the rest. We like to believe we don't conform to
        social norms.
    </p>

    <p>
        We're a generation that calls itself ‘sexually liberated'. We can tell sex apart from love, or so we think.
        We're the hook-up-break-up generation. We have sex first and then decide if we want to love someone. Sex comes
        easy, loyalty doesn't. Getting laid has become the new getting drunk. You do it not because you love the other
        person, but because you want to feel good. It's all the temporary fulfillment we need. Sex outside relationships
        isn't a taboo anymore. Relationships aren't that simple anymore. There are open relationships, friends with
        benefits, causal flings, one-night stands, no strings attached – we've left very little exclusivity for love in
        our lives.
    </p>

    <p>
        We're the practical generation who runs by logic alone. We don't know how to love madly anymore. We wouldn't
        take a flight to a far-off land just to see someone we love. We'd break up because, long distance. We're too
        sensible for love. Too sensible for our own good.
    </p>

    <p>
        We're a scared generation – scared to fall in love, scared to commit, scared to fall, scared to get hurt, scared
        to get our hearts broken. We don't allow anyone in, nor do we step out and love anyone unconditionally. We lurk
        from behind walls we've created ourselves, looking for love and running away the moment we really find it. We
        suddenly ‘cannot handle it'. We don't want to be vulnerable. We don't want to bare our soul to anyone. We're too
        guarded.
    </p>

    <p>
        We don't even value relationships anymore. We let go of the most wonderful people for ‘the other fishes in the
        sea.' We don't consider them sacred anymore.
    </p>

    <p>
        There's nothing we couldn't conquer in this world, and yet, here we are ham-fisted at the game of love – the
        most basic of human instincts. Evolution, they call it.
